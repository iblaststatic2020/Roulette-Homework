# Roulette-Homework
Homework assignment.
This is a project from www.javavideotutorials.net the idea is to keep playing the game until you earn 10 chips a turn.
At least that's how I understand it.
I know this code is not optimized, but would appreciate any help anyone could offer as far as refactoring would go.
Thanks for taking a look.
